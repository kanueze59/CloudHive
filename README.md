# CloudHive# CloudHive — Tokenized Decentralized Cloud Compute Marketplace

A blockchain-based platform for decentralized cloud computing, enabling users to rent, share, and verify compute and storage resources via smart contracts.

## Overview

This system consists of ten main smart contracts that coordinate different aspects of decentralized compute and storage operations:

1. **Marketplace Contract** – Lists and matches compute/storage offers
2. **Job Management Contract** – Manages compute job submissions and completions
3. **Payment Escrow Contract** – Locks and releases funds based on job success
4. **Reputation Contract** – Tracks node performance and ratings
5. **Staking Contract** – Secures provider behavior with token stakes
6. **Dispute Resolution Contract** – Handles mediation between users and providers
7. **SLA Enforcement Contract** – Enforces uptime and service reliability
8. **Resource Tokenization Contract** – Tokenizes compute/storage rights as NFTs
9. **Governance Contract** – Enables DAO-based protocol upgrades and decisions
10. **Identity Contract** – Manages node verification and role permissions

## Features

- Decentralized compute and storage rentals  
- Automated SLA enforcement and payments  
- Transparent reputation and staking system  
- Dispute resolution through on-chain arbitration  
- Tokenized access to computing resources  
- DAO-based governance for protocol changes  
- Clarity smart contract architecture

- Transferable and tradable resources

### Governance Contract

- Proposal submission and voting  
- Upgrade scheduling  
- Treasury management

### Identity Contract

## Installation

1. Install Clarinet CLI  
2. Clone this repository  
3. Run tests: `npm test`  
4. Deploy contracts: `clarinet deploy`

## Usage

Each smart contract module is independent and deployable. Refer to the `/contracts` folder for logic, and `/tests` for implementation examples. Integrate front-end tools via stacks.js or connect to backend compute nodes through supported RPCs.

## Testing

All unit and integration tests are written using Clarinet's test runner.

```bash
npm test
```
